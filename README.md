Wire Bae
A Seamless, Vibey Connectivity Platform

Welcome to Wire Bae, an AI-powered, 3D interactive music experience. This project blends sultry, hypnotic tech with a rebellious edge, syncing a dynamic digital world of music and visuals in real-time. Inspired by hip-hop basslines and neon-lit cyberpunk aesthetics, Wire Bae delivers a glossy, progressive feel for creators, tech enthusiasts, and vibe-seekers craving bold, interactive digital experiences.
Features

    Immersive 3D Environment: A neon-drenched world featuring a dynamic grid, a starfield, and pulsing environmental objects that react to the music.

    AI-Powered Visuals: A central, dragonfly-inspired entity with an autonomous flight path and music-driven animations.

    Interactive Music Controls:

        Genre Selection: Switch between four distinct hip-hop subgenres: Cyber-Funk, Trap, Lo-fi, and Old School.

        Vibe Manipulation: Control the audio in real-time by moving the cursor. Vertical movement adjusts a low-pass filter, while horizontal movement controls the playback speed.

    Customizable Vibe Sliders: A full GUI panel allows for deep personalization of the scene:

        Adjust the intensity of the Neon Glow.

        Change the color of the Particles, Grid, and Dragonfly.

        Control the density of the atmospheric Fog.

    Interactive Sound Grid:

        Place different objects (Kick, Hat, Note, Pad) on the grid to create your own beats.

        A visual playhead sweeps across the grid, triggering the sounds in a 16-step sequence.

        Start, stop, and clear the sequencer on the fly.

    Share Your Vibe: Capture a snapshot of your customized scene and share it across other platforms with a link back to the project.
